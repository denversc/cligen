Cligen is a code generator for command-line argument parsers.  It is similar
in concept to the traditional Lex and Yacc compilers, which produce general-
purpose parsers.  Cligen is much simpler and is able to generate command-line
argument parsers in a number of different languages.  The arguments are
specific in an XML document.
